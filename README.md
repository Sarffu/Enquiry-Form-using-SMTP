This Django-based web application is designed to securely handle and process form submissions. 
It features an enquiry form where users can submit their name, email, mobile number, and a message. 
The application efficiently processes and stores these submissions, showcasing Django's capabilities for form handling and database management.
Additionally, the application includes an automated email notification system. If a user submits an enquiry within 24 hours of their previous submission, they will receive an email notification. 
This system ensures users are informed and can submit a new enquiry only after 24 hours, allowing them to receive a callback from the backend team.
